This project will show you how to set up a couple of ADC channels using DMA. We'll be using a couple of potentiometers for our ADC inputs.
The code will take channel 1 and convert the 12 bit ADC value (0-4095) to a Volume range of 0-30 by using interpolation calculation.
The 2nd ADC channel 15, will show the Pot voltage 0 to ~3.3V.
